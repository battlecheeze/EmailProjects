            <p style="font-size: 13px;">Attn firstname:</p>
            <p style="font-size: 13px;">I am special Agent Brian D. Lamkin; from the Intelligence Unit of the MI5. We just intercepted/confiscated two (2) Trunk Boxes at the East Midlands Airport in 	Castle Donington, Leicestershire. We are on the verge of moving this consignment to the bureau headquarters. However, we scanned the said boxes and found out that it contained a total of <span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">$4,100,000 USD (FOUR MILLION AND ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND US DOLLARS)</span> and some back up documents which bears your name as the owner of the funds. Investigation carried your on the Diplomat who accompanied these boxes into the United Kingdom, revealed that he was to make the delivery of the funds to your residence as these funds are enttitled to you, being Contract/Inheritance over due payments. The funds were from the office of the Ministry of Finance, Federal Government of Nigeria.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 13px;">Furthermore, after cross checking all the legal documents we found in the boxes backing you up as the beneficiary of the funds, it became known to us that one of the documents is missing. This document is very important and until we get the document, the boxes will be temporarily confiscated pending when you will provide it. The much needed document is the Diplomatic Immunity Seal of Delivery (DISD). This document will protect you from going against The Official Secrets Act 1989 of Section 6 and Section 8. This delivery will be tagged A Diplomatic Transit Payment (S.T.D.P.) once you get the document.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 13px;">You are therefor required to get back to me within 72 hours so that I will guide you on how to get the much needed document. Failure to comply to this directives may lead to the permanent confiscation of the funds and possible arrest. We may also get the UK Financial Intelligence Unit on Money Laundering involved if do not follow your instructions. You are also advised not to get in contact with any Bank in Africa, Europe or any other institution, as your funds are here now in the United Kingdom.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 13px;">Yours faithfully,</p>
            <p style="font-size: 13px; margin-bottom: 0 !important;">Agent Brian D. Lamkin</p>
