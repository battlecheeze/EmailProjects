We thought that the UK National lottery board gave you our contact details to contact us, it may interest you to note that a letter was also added to your FedEx package, however we cannot read the full content to you via email for privacy/security reasons we understand that the package itself is a winning bank Cashier cheque which worth over <span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">$1,500.000.00 {USD ONE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATE DOLLAR}</span> As you may know the FedEx Delivery Express Service world-wide do not ship money in CASH but Bank Drafts/winning cheques are shippable. The package is registered with us for mailing by the UK National Lottery Promotion Board, We are sending you this email because your package is been registered on a Special delivery Order on our desk by (U.K NLB). What you have to do now is to go to our <a href="#" style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 14px;">Delivery Department page</a> for immediate dispatch of your package to your residential address in your country.</p>

For your information, the VAT & Shipping charges as well as the Insurance fees have been paid by the UK National Lottery Board, before your package was registered. Note that the payment that is made on the Insurance, Premium & Clearance Certificates, is to certify that the winning cheque is not for Drug Affiliated Fund (DAF) neither is it a fund to sponsor Terrorism in your country. This will help you avoid any form of query from the Monetary Authority of your country. Note that you will have to pay total Security fees of $221 USD to the FedEx Security Company UK being full payment for the Security Keeping Fee of your package as stated in our privacy terms & conditions page. Also be informed that the UK National Lottery Promotion Company wishes you to pay for the Security Keeping charges, but we do not accept such payment just like that considering the fact that all items & packages that is registered with us have a time limitation and we cannot accept payment that is not known to us, so you are to send us your full detail so we can furnish you with our own payment procedures for the security keeping fee of your parcel containing $1,500,000.00 USD.</p>
