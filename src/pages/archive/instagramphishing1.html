      <h3 class="text-center">Verified Badges</h3>
      <p class="text-center">A verified badge is a check that appears next to an Instagram acccount's name in 
        search and on the profile. It means that Instagram has confirmed that this is the authentic account
        for the public figure, celebrity or global brand it represents.
      </p>
      <p class="text-center">
        Accounts representing well-known figures and brands are verified because they have a high likelihood
        of being impersonated. We want to make sure that people in the Instagram community can easily find the 
        authentic people and brands they want to follow.
