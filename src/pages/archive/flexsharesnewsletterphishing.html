      <p style="padding: 0 38px 0 37px !important;">We believe that adding the quality factor to a low volatility strategy may play a pivotal role in helping to reduce future volatility in client portfolios. Our approach to quality integrates rigorous fundamental analysis through a quality-scoring model that has three components. The core three components of the quality-scoring model are based on quantitative ranking of various metrics obtained from company filings consisting of: Management Expertise (e.g. corporate finance activities), Profitability (e.g. assess the reliability and the sustainability of financial performance) and Cash Flow (e.g. cash flow generation).</p>
      <p style="padding: 0 38px 0 37px !important;">We don't just hope but we believe that this is different from other low volatility funds that may utilize only historical returns and/or correlation data in the hope that lower volatility will carry forward.</p>
      <p style="padding: 0 38px 0 37px !important;">Learn more about how the FlexShares Quality Low Volatility Index suite of funds utilizes an index that considers exposure to the low volatility factor in the construction of a final portfolio as the final step - giving investors what our analysis suggests is a more efficient means of accessing this important factor.</p>

          The FlexShares US Quality Low Volatility Index Fund (QLV), FlexShares Developed Markets ex-US Quality Low Volatility Index Fund (QLVD) and the FlexShares Emerging Markets Quality Low Volatility Index Fund (QLVE) are passively managed and use a representative sampling strategy to track their underlying indexes. Use of a representative sampling strategy creates tracking risk where the Fund’s performance could vary substantially from the performance of the underlying indexes along with the risk of higher portfolio turnover. Although the funds seek lower volatility than their broader respective markets, there is no guarantee they will be successful as securities or other assets in the Fund’s portfolio may be subject to greater price volatility than the market as a whole. Foreign and emerging market securities involve certain risks such as currency volatility, political and social instability and reduced market liquidity. The Funds may also invest in derivative instruments. Changes in the value of the derivative may not correlate with the underlying asset, rate or index and the Funds could lose more than the principal amount invested. The Funds are also is at increased risk of Industry Concentration, where it may be more than 25% invested in the assets of a single industry.
