      <p>Dear {\{firstname\}},</p>
      <p>Thank you for being an early member of Netflix - we hope you're enjoying your membership. </p>
      <p>We are making some updates to how we process payments in UK. In order to
      continue your membership, you will need to provide a new payment method that
      is different from your current payment method. Only <strong>Only UK issued cards
        are accepted.</strong> Please <a href="{\URL{\}}">visit Netflix</a> and
      update your payment method before your next billing date on {\{DATE+7\}}</p>
