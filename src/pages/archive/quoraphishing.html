      <p style="font-size: 13px;">Dear firstname lastname</p>
      <p style="font-size: 13px;">We are writing to let you know that we recently discovered that some user 
      data was compromised as a result of unauthorized access to our systems by a malicious third party. We 
      are very sorry for any concern or inconvenience this may cause. We are working rapidly to investigate 
      the situation further and take the appropriate steps to prevent such incidents in the future.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 13px;">It is our responsibility to make sure things like this don't happen, and we failed to meet that responsibility. We recognize that in order to maintain user trust, we need to work very hard to make sure this does not happen again.</p>
