            <p>We could not confirm the address associated with your Amazon account. As a result, we have disabled the ability for anyone to login to your account to avoid account misuse. To resolve this, a verification process is required to be completed</p>
            <h3><a href="#" style="text-decoration: underline;">Verify Account Information now</a></h3>
            <p>Note that this is required to be completed to enable us re-enable access to your Amazon.com account. And all Information should be provided as contained on file.</p>
            <p>Thanks,</p>
